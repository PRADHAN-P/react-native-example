# React Native / Redux Example

Extracted from ProFit App.

## Start the project

`npm start`

From XCode project make sure you have commented line in AppDelegate.m file for debugging mode (don't forget to uncomment this line before archive project for production):

`// jsCodeLocation = [[NSBundle mainBundle] URLForResource:@"main" withExtension:@"jsbundle"];`

also in Product -> Scheme -> Edit Scheme 'Build Configuration' option set to 'Debug' then just start the project from the XCode.
